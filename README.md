CovidBubble is a way to track your risk to maintain a healthy social life while still being safe with the covid outbreak. It has a simple and easy to use UI and provides many ways to advocate for a policy. We are proud of successfully calling the ArcGIS API to return the nearby covid hotspots.
Our website calculates the daily covid risk using the user inputted data with factors such as number of people the user has seen and how many restaurants they have dined in. The tracker also provides a map of nearby covid hotspots.
